# OpenCV
In this reposetory, I'm adding all the OpenCV programs I've written while working on my AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) project.

Currently it I've only written two so far.
-Color Detection
-Rectangle and Square Detection

My next program I'm working on is a verticle like detecting program.
This program will be useful for out robot because one of the challenges our must complete is to navigate through a gate.
This gate wil be a rectangle without the bottom side. The vertical detection will be able to detect the two vertical lines of the rectangle.
